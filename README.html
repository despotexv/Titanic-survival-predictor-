    <h1>Titanic Survival Prediction Project</h1>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>This project aims to analyze and predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning algorithms. It involves cleaning, exploring, and modeling the dataset with the goal of identifying key factors that influenced survival rates.</p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Comprehensive data analysis to understand passenger demographics and characteristics.</li>
        <li>Preprocessing data to prepare for machine learning modeling.</li>
        <li>Applying various machine learning techniques to predict survival outcomes.</li>
        <li>Evaluating and comparing the performance of different models.</li>
        <li>Identifying key factors that contributed to passenger survival.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Python: For data processing and machine learning.</li>
        <li>Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.</li>
        <li>Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.</li>
        <li>Scikit-Learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms.</li>
        <li>Jupyter Notebook: For interactive code execution and presentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
    <p>The dataset includes features such as Passenger ID, Survival, Ticket Class, Sex, Age, Fare, Cabin, and Embarkation point. Missing values were handled, and feature engineering was applied to create new meaningful features.</p>

    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Analysis of survival rates by different passenger characteristics like age, gender, and class.</li>
        <li>Insights into the distribution of passengers by various categories.</li>
        <li>Identification of key features that most influenced survival outcomes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Modeling and Evaluation</h2>
    <p>Several models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest were implemented. The models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted for model optimization.</p>

    <h2>Future Scope</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Implementing advanced machine learning models and ensembles for improved accuracy.</li>
        <li>Further exploration of feature engineering and selection techniques.</li>
        <li>Deploying the model as a web application for interactive use.</li>
    </ul>
